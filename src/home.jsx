      <h1 className="title">Pros of a Paper To-Do List System</h1>

      <p className="subtitle">Paper Is Convenient</p>
      <a className="subtitle">
        It’s hard to beat the convenience of a paper to-do list. Fans of paper
        lists can jot down ideas in notebooks, on index cards, sticky notes,
        scrap paper and even napkins if you’re really in a pinch. You can take
        your list with you anywhere without worrying about low battery warnings,
        spotty reception, or the hunt for free wifi.

      <p className="subtitle">It’s a Great Experience</p>
      <a className="subtitle">
        Despite years of typing and tapping on digital devices, some people
        still prefer the experience of pen on paper. A paper to-do list has an
        intuitive user experience that’s hard to beat. Plus, there’s that great
        feeling of accomplishment that comes from crossing off items on your
        list.

      <p className="subtitle">Free of Tech Hassles</p>
      <a className="subtitle">
        There’s no worry of platform compatibility, app updates, data backups or
        other tech hassles when you’re using a paper list. Pretty much any
        writing implement can write on any kind of paper, in handwriting that
        will always be legible to you. If you get tired of cards or sticky notes
        and decide to upgrade to a to-do list notebook or even switch between
        notebooks, it’s no problem. You just copy over what’s needed.

      <p className="subtitle">FLess Screen Time</p>
      <a className="subtitle">
        With so much time spent sitting at a computer desk or hunched over a
        mobile screen, it can be nice to take a break. Paper will give you a
        nice ergonomic break from your day-to-day patterns and a mental break
        from digital distractions that can pop up as you’re managing your
        electronic list. Paper to-do lists are also definitely easier on the
        eyes — no fonts settings to bump up for readability and no blue glare to
        give you insomnia.
